Hi! I'm Aryan, a junior CS student at Cornell University.

I enjoy building web applications on all levels of the tech stack. I am very passionate about systems programming and cloud computing, and also occasionally dabble in machine learning.

On my Github, you can find some of my notable projects - two that I am particularly proud of are [Distributed Database](https://github.com/Aryan77/distributed-database) and [Minimal Browser](https://github.com/Aryan77/minimal-browser).

Do visit my [blog](https://aryanyadav.dev) if you are interested in these projects - I explore them and other interesting topics related to Systems Programming, Backend Web Development and Cloud Computing.

You can email me at [yadavaryan424@gmail.com](mailto:yadavaryan424@gmail.com) or [ay394@cornell.edu](mailto:ay394@cornell.edu).
